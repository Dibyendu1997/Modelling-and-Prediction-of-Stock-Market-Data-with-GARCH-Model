# Introduction
Time series of returns from financial instruments usually exhibit nonlinearities. There is strong empirical evidence that a large number of time series
from finance and economics show some stylized facts such as clusters of highly variable observations followed by clusters of observations with low variability
and strong autocorrelations either in the series or its squares. In this Project we examine some of the models proposed to account for these features. In par-
ticular, we consider heteroskedastic time series models where the conditional variance given the past is no longer constant

In This Project We Use ARMA-GARCH Model for Modeling Four different type of Stock Markets .   

# Data Collection
We Use NIFTY 50 , NIFTY NEXT 50 , NIFTY MIDCAP ,NIFTY SMALL CAP for this project .We use Data from March 23, 2020 to Sep 24, 2021 and use this data for predecting stock market price for next 20 days. We Collect our data from [Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ENSEI/history/) .
